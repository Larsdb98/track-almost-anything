# Track Almost Anything

This Python-based software allows users to track various items or objects via a camera. This software will have various object detection algorithms (from Ultralysics' YOLO, Google's mediapipe, etc.) alongside tracking algorithms.

###Â Installation

1. Install [poetry][https://python-poetry.org]

2. Clone the project

    ```zsh
    git clone https://github.com/Larsdb98/track-almost-anything.git
    ```

3. Install the poetry environment:

    ```zsh
    poetry install
    ```

4. Some packages will be missing because they can't be tracked properly with poetry. These have to be manually installed:

    ```zsh
    poetry run pip install ultralytics
    poetry run pip install torch
    ```

### Developing the UI

I'm a robotics engineer, not a frontend developer. So I'm cutting corners and using Qt Designer to create a UI file that I then convert to Python.

To open Qt Designer within the poetry environment:

```bash
poetry run pyside6-designer
```
